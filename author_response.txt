We thank the reviewers for their introspection of our results and constructive feedback.

REVIEW 1
	As said in our Conclusion, we plan to model instructor intervention based on the threads they have 
	seen and based on the role that different types of instructional staff play.

1.  Our method is also suitable for other online learning 
	environments too but not to web forums. PDTB connectives occur in 
	complete grammatical sentences. Although MOOC forums are user generated they more 
	grammatical than web forums.

2.	We agree that the complete solution is to predict
	interventions for each post rather than once for each thread. However, post level prediction 
	is different from our current problem since threads become more visible once intervened. 
	Further, the purpose and progression of a discussion needs tracking which differ between  
	humanities and hard science subjects. While we do not handle it in this work discourse 
	connectives could be useful for post level prediction too.

3. 	Yes, the distribution for MOOC corpus are based on tags from  
	the discourse parser. We acknowledge the possibility pointed 
	out. However, we cite Faulkner et al. (2014), Wang et al (2012), 
	Swanson et al (2015) who use the parser without retraining. Not retraining is reasonable since retraining  
	needs annotated corpus creation without an estimate of the parser's utility 
	for the task. We will consider annotation in our future work.
	
4. 	This is not an error.
	Courses in Table 2 with 0 F_1 scores have have very few interventions (see Table 1).
	Five fold cross validation further diminishes the number of interventions to  
	3 to 4 per fold. So neither model is able to predict any intervention for these 
	courses in the in-domain evaluation.

5. 	We agree that all the models have a high false positive rate. However, for our problem, 
	recall is more important than precision since it is costlier to miss interventions than 
	to predict more.

6 and 7.  Both these are typos which we regret. 

	We compare the gains made in weighted macro average on page 5, para 2.
	We state that, "The EDM'15 model only improved by 4.3%, whereas the E+P model improved 
	by 6.9%". This should instead be: "The EDM'15 model only improved by 2.7%, 
	whereas the E+P model improved by 5.7%".

REVIEW 2
The discussion of research question 2 and Table 5 is somewhat confusing...
	No. The comparison in Table 5 and research question 2 is between EDM 
	and PDTB model which has just the PDTB features.

We agree with your suggestion. Due to space constraints we only highlight them in Conclusion and Abstract. 
They are:
		We better the state-of-the-art for intervention prediction 
		by augmenting it with PDTB relation based features. Further, on select MOOC 
		offerings PDTB relations alone performed comparably to the state-of-the-art.
		Unlike vocabulary based models, PDTB based features were shown to be robust 
		to domain differences across MOOCs.

REVIEW 3
	We find that 'Contingency' and 'Expansion' relations contribute 
	the most perhaps due to their higher occurrence in the corpus.
